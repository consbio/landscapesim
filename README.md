# landscapesim
landscapesim provides a RESTful web API for running State and Transition Simulation Models (STSMs) and collecting tabular
and spatially referenced data stored in [SyncroSim](syncrosim.com) data stores. landscapesim also provides a configurable interface
for modifying parameters for existing STSMs, allowing users to experiment and compare different scenario outcomes from customized,
web-based applications.

# Why?
We needed to provide a reusable and extendable interface that transports information easily to incorporate STSM models into
 web-based tools for landscape managers and researchers. This allows us to drive visualization tools for the web while utilizing
 a standardized platform that can be incorporated into other tools.

# Use cases
[landscapesim.org](http://landscapesim.org) utilizes a custom implementation of landscapesim, enabling managers and researchs to utilize 
 information provided from STSMs from within a web application. It provides a simple toolbox to change parameters to an STSM model and
 exposes results to drive the visualizations in the tool, including 3D terrain visualizations, tables and charts.

# Attribution
landscapesim would not be possible without the exhaustive work on [SyncroSim](syncrosim.com) from Colin J. Daniel, Leonardo Fid, Benjamin M. Sleeter, 
Marie-Josee Fortin, and many, many others pushing the bounds on spatially explicit simulation models focused on ecology and landscape management.
