# landscapesim-api
The landscapesim-api provides a RESTful web API into a State and Transition Simulation Model (STSM) stored in a
[SyncroSim](syncrosim.com) library. 

# Why?
We wanted to provide a reusable interface with cultivated STSM models that transports information easily to incorporate into tools
 utilizing STSMs. This allows us to create visualization tools for different projects, while utilizing a standardized service.

# Use cases
[Landscapesim.org](landscapesim.org) utilizes a simplified version of the landscapesim-api, enabling users of the model to run
 the tool from within a web application. We harness the power of SyncroSim's ST-Sim model process and expose the results
 of model runs to drive the visualizations, including 3D terrain visualization, charts and tables.

# Attribution
The landscapesim-api would not be possible without the work on [SyncroSim](syncrosim.com) from Colin J. Daniel, Leonardo Fid, Benjamin M. Sleeter, 
Marie-Josee Fortin, and many, many others pushing the bounds on spatially explicit simulation models.
