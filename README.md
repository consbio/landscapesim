# landscapesim
The landscapesim project provides a RESTful web API for State and Transition Simulation Models (STSMs) stored in a
[SyncroSim](syncrosim.com) library. 

# Why?
We needed to provide a reusable, extendable interface that transports information easily to incorporate STSM models into tools
 for landscape managers and researchers. This allows us to drive visualization tools for the web, while utilizing a standardized platform.

# Use cases
[landscapesim.org](http://landscapesim.org) utilizes a simplified version of landscapesim, enabling users of the model to run STSMs from within a web application.
It provides a gateway into using SyncroSim's ST-Sim model process and exposes the model run results to drive the visualizations, including 3D terrain visualization, charts and tables.

# Attribution
landscapesim would not be possible without the work on [SyncroSim](syncrosim.com) from Colin J. Daniel, Leonardo Fid, Benjamin M. Sleeter, 
Marie-Josee Fortin, and many, many others pushing the bounds on spatially explicit simulation models focused on ecology and landscape management.
