# django_stsim 0.1.0
django_stsim exposes State and Transition Simulation models stored in [SyncroSim](syncrosim.com) .ssim libraries as a REST service.

# Why?
We wanted to provide a way to interface with prepared models and serve that information is various web formats. This allows us to create visualization tools for different projects, while utilizing a standardized service.

# Use cases
[Landscapesim.org](landscapesim.org) utilizes a simplified version of django_stsim for serving up information stored in a .ssim library to enable the model run process from a web application as well as drive the information represented in the 3D visualization.
